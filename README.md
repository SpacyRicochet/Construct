# Construct: D&D companion app in SwiftUI

![](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/dee59819-1d72-4a54-b70c-4b8bed188efd/branches/main/badge)

## Project Goals
I want the project to be...
- 🐉 an easy to use companion app for Dungeon Masters running [5th edition D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons)
- 🎓 a resource for developers learning [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)

### For Dungeon Masters
The easiest way to use the app is by downloading it from the App Store.

### For developers
Download or checkout the repository and open `Construct.xcworkspace`.

I hope to write posts detailing some of the interesting parts of the app in the future.
