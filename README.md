## Project Goals
This project aims to be...
- üêâ an easy to use companion app for Dungeon Masters running [5th edition D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons)
- üéì a resource for developers learning [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)

### For Dungeon Masters
The easiest way to use the app is by downloading it from the App Store.

You can find an overview of Construct's features at [construct5e.app](https://www.construct5e.app).

### For developers
Download or checkout the repository and open `Construct.xcworkspace`.

I hope to write posts detailing some of the interesting parts of the app in the future.
